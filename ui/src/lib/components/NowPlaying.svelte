		<!-- === Original layout ===
		     The artwork itself, blurred to a wash, is the background: same trick as HomeHero, and it
		     needs no colour extraction (which a remote image would taint the canvas for anyway). The
		     120px variant is the one the player bar has already loaded for this track, so this costs
		     no request and nothing new to decode.
		     Two opacities because the wash sits on opposite grounds: over white it has to stay pale
		     enough for dark text, over near-black it can carry more colour before muted-foreground
		     stops reading. Turn them up together if it's too subtle.

		     Not while a video is playing. WebKitGTK re-runs this 40px blur for the damaged region on
		     every video frame, and the damaged region is the video, so the cost grows with the window.
		     Measured 2026-08-20 on a 1100px box, 720p30: with the wash 13 fps of video and 74ms UI
		     frames, without it 30 fps and 17ms. Layer promotion does not help (will-change,
		     translateZ(0) and contain:paint all measured as noise), and the cost tracks the blur
		     radius rather than the image. A video fills the view on its own, so there is nothing to
		     replace it with. -->

		<!-- Capped and centred, so a wide window doesn't park the artwork in the middle of an empty
		     half with the tabs glued to the right edge. --art is the artwork's side: whichever is
		     smaller of the column's width and the height left over once the titlebar, the player bar
		     and this padding have had theirs, at 75% so the square doesn't dominate the view.
		     ponytail: 11rem is those three measured, not computed. The 0.75 leaves it plenty of
		     slack now, so only a much taller player bar would need it raised.

		     A video gets its own budget, and a wider cap to spend it in. 16:9 in the square's width
		     leaves half the height empty, so --vid is the width that spends the same leftover height
		     instead: height * 16 / 9, capped by the column (max-width can only shrink `w-full`). The
		     80rem cap exists to stop a square drifting into an empty half, which a video this wide
		     never does. -->
