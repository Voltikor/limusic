# Tempo, pitch and reverb

Open **Tempo, Pitch & Reverb** from the player bar's ⋮ menu. Effects apply to the
listening session and reset on app restart. Saved custom presets retain their
settings on this device; select one to reapply it. Changes synchronize between
the main window and Mini Player. Reset restores the default playback settings.

| Control | Range | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tempo | 0.5–2× | 1×; preserves pitch. Disabled during shared listening. |
| Pitch | −12 to +12 semitones | 0; independent of Tempo. |
| Reverb | On/off | Off; retains its controls when disabled. |
| Dry | 0–100% | 100%; original song level, independent of Wet. |
| Wet | 0–100% | 25%; added reflections. |
| Decay | 0.1–10 s | 1.1 s nominal RT60; also changes reflection spacing. |
| Pre-delay | 0–200 ms | 0 ms; additional wet-path delay. |
| Damping | 500–20,000 Hz | 8,000 Hz; wet-path low-pass cutoff. |
| Early reflections | 0–100% | 100%; level of the IR's first 80 ms. |

Sliders apply on release or a keyboard step. Dry and Wet are independent levels;
raising Wet does not automatically reduce Dry. A limiter prevents the combined
signal from clipping. In shared listening, presets apply Pitch and Reverb while
preserving their saved Tempo for solo playback.

The player and OS media controls display listening seconds: a four-minute track
lasts five minutes at 0.8×. Seeking converts that time back to source seconds;
lyrics retain the source timeline.

## Processing and limits

The order is gain → Rubber Band → Reverb → limiter. With audible Reverb,
Rubber Band runs inside the same FFmpeg graph, avoiding mpv's unsupported native
stretch-before-lavfi ordering. Source-clock timestamps and a sample-copying
scaletempo adapter retain mpv's playback timing without stretching twice.
Reverb off or Wet zero uses native Rubber Band. Normal Tempo with Pitch zero
bypasses stretching. Both paths use the R3 short window and shifted formants.
The room uses embedded, reproducible stereo impulse responses; no audio dependency
is added. Settings, per-track gain and rejected updates are handled on both decks.

The FFmpeg Rubber Band wrapper can discard buffered audio at EOF, truncating a
song's final sound. This known limitation remains in the accepted processing
order. Changing effects or seeking resets the room tail; full tails require audio
or silence after the last note. Runtime validation so far covers the bundled
Windows libmpv; Linux/macOS and older FFmpeg behavior remain unverified.

## Validation

Player tests cover actual PCM output, every room control, both decks, gain,
rollback, escaped cache paths, live controls, seeking, playback rate and the
original metadata/channel-layout log regressions. UI checks cover saved presets,
including legacy Tempo migration and the shared-listening restriction.
